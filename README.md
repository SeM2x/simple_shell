# Simple Shell

This is a simple \*nix shell, written in C, std=89 because I hate myself.

## How to run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kiskiller0/shell
./build.sh
```

the first time you run build.sh, it's gonna build and run the shell, if you need to run it again:

```sh
./main
```

Have fun! (idk how, just trying to be polite ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯  )
